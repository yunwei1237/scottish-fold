 Parrying attacks with your weapon is a little bit more difficult than blocking them with a shield.\

 If you are blocking upwards, you will parry any overhead swings coming against you, but you will not stop thrusts or attacks to your sides.\

My brother-in-law, cursed be his name, said that it was not our custom that women could inherit a thanedom.

My mother's family. whom I hoped would give me a start in trading, have not been as welcoming as I have hoped. I receive nothing but lectures from my aunts, on how I have ruined my prospects for marriage by taking service in a mercenary company. Perhaps I am better suited to war than to commerce, to share a meal over a campfire with rough fellows than to drink wine with the burghers of Veluca. {Sir/Madame}, I must ask you -- will you take me back?"),

For my part, I've been having some difficulties coaxing a living from my estates -- locusts, bad rains, unruly serfs, that sort of thing. I thought I might take up the sword once more. I know there's been some bad blood between us, but I'd be honoured to fight in your ranks once again."),

I took a ship out of Wercheg, bound for the east, but it was taken by pirates and after my ransom I was set ashore back here. There may be better places in the world than Calradia, but I have yet to see them. So I think, if it is my lot to live here, then your company is as good a livelihood as any. Will you have me back?"),

I have been hunting among the Nords here, to see if I could find enough men to take back my husband's hall. But I could not find enough men to crew a longship, and those whom I gathered quickly got bored and wandered off -- not, I will add, before they drank away such gold as I had accumulated. So I thought back to the battles we fought together. Those were good days, and profitable ones too."),

I left you because I wasn't satisfied with the warrior's life, but I spend a bit of time in town and I realize that there's worse things in life than a full belly, honest companions, and the joy of seeing the enemy run before you. So, would you be hiring again"),
  ("npc12_rehire_speech", "Captain! It's a fine thing to see an honest face like yours. This world is full of lies. I went home to publish my findings, hired some scribes and made a handful of codices, and waited for the commissions. But it turns out that the universities don't care about real medical knowledge rather than warmed-over Galerian. And publishers -- let me tell you, you never saw anyone so unscrupulous. They rent the books out chapter to by chapter to students to copy, but half of them aren't returned, and those that are have pages soaked in wine, and there's no longer a complete copy of my work anywhere. I'll keep trying, but first I need a bit of money in my pocket, first. Are you looking for a surgeon?"),

I will admit that I felt a twinge of regret that we had parted ways, and, I'll confess, a twinge of jealousy as well at your reputation. I thought that once again I might fight by your side, and thus bask in the reflection of your glory. Perhaps we might ride together again, for a little while?"),
  ("npc14_rehire_speech", "Captain. It is good to see you. When last we parted, I was ready to swear that I would not serve you again, but perhaps I judged you too harshly. All over Calradia, men sing your praises. I have tried serving in other lords' armies, and believe me, what I have seen of them restores my opinion of your leadership. If you would have me in your company, I would fight for you again."),
  ("npc15_rehire_speech", "Why hello, {playername}. I can't say I'm entirely displeased to see you. You see, I took on another contract before I left, and sure enough, when it came time to collect the pay, the lord had nothing but talk and excuses and petty little complaints about my handiwork. I can't say I was always happy in your company, but at least I put gold directly into my purse after every battle. You still offering work?"),
  ("npc16_rehire_speech", "Captain! They say that you've done well for yourself since we last met. I'll come out and admit that I cursed your name when we parted ways, but thinking back on it you weren't all that bad. All these lords, they're glad enough to send me on little side errands, but they don't much care to have me in their main battle-line. Apparently I spook the men. I've heard it muttered that I'm a witch, or that I eat men's hearts after killing them, or other rot. Not that I mind stabbing a man while he's asleep, but it's a lot more gratifying when he's awake and kicking. So I thought I'd try to find you again, see if you'll take me on."),

Just like the Vaegirs, Swadians, Rhodoks and Nords, we took the Emperor's coin to keep the other tribes at bay.

That's why they threw me out of the university, although in retrospect that was a blessing.

I'd put together an army of Rhodok spears with Nord footmen on the flanks and Vaegir archers in front, take along some Khergit scouts to find and fix the enemy, and some Swadian lancers to finish them off. I'd take that army over the mountains and make the whole world kneel to Calradia.... Of course, that's what the Emperors thought, and in the end the tribes took away their Empire."),

You can guess how long that lasted. One Rhodok hill chieftain sets himself up in Culmarr, calls himself 'Count', and the good burghers of Jelkala and Veluca have to lick his boots if they want to sell their wine and velvet outside Calradia. And if you want to keep the counts under control, and the peasants providing the towns with food rather than selling to the highest bidder, then you need a King too, don't you? The Rhodok lands are no different than anyone else, whatever guff they talk about 'ancient liberties' and 'freedom.'"),

  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_intro",       "I am Lethwin Far-Seeker, son of Hakrim the Old, who should be king of the Nords of Calradia."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_intro",     "I am Lord Kastor, the rightful King of the Rhodoks, who will free them from tyranny."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "I was the only child of my father, King Esterich. Although I am a woman, he loved me like a son and named me his heir -- not once, but several times, before the grandest nobles of the land so that none could doubt his intention. There is no law that bars a woman from ruling -- indeed, we Swadians tell tales of warrior queens who ruled us in our distant past."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "My father died when I was young, leaving me in the care of his brother, the regent Burelek. But rather than hold the throne until I came of age, this usurper used his newfound power to accuse my mother of adultery, and to claim that I was not my father's son. She was executed for treason, and I was declared a bastard."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_1",  "Sanjar Khan and I are brothers, sons of the old Janakir Khan, although of different mothers. Although I was the younger brother, all those who knew the old Khan will testify that throughout my father's life, I was his favorite, entrusted with the responsibilities of government. Sanjar busied himself with hunts and feasts to win the affection of the more dissolate of my father's commanders."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_1",     "I am called the Far-Seeker because I have travelled great distances, even by the standards of the Nords, in search of knowledge. Before I came of age, my father sent me abroad on a tour of study at the courts and universities in the lands overseas. If the Nords are to call themselves the heirs of the Calradian empire, then they must act the part, and know something of law and letters, and not call themselves content merely to fight, plunder, and drink."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_1",   "The Rhodoks are a free people, and not slaves to any hereditary monarch. The king must be chosen from one of the leading noble families of the land, by a council drawn by lot from the patricians of the cities of Jelkala, Veluca, and Yalen. The council meets on a field before Jelkala, and no man is allowed to appear in arms during their deliberations, on pain of death."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "Yet when my father died, his cousin Harlaus convinced the nobles that no Swadian king of sound mind could name a woman as his heir. Harlaus said that his designation of me was the act of a madman, and thus had no legal standing, and that he, as my father's closest male relative, should of take the throne."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "I was smuggled abroad by a faithful servant, but now I am of age and have returned to reclaim what is rightfully mine. Burelek died soon after his act of perfidy -- the judgment of heaven, no doubt. His son Yaroglek now calls himself king, but as his claim is tainted, he is no less a usurper than his father, and I will topple him from his throne."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_2",  "According to Khergit custom, when a man dies his herds are split between all his sons, equally. So too it is with the khanate. When I heard of my father's death, I was away inspecting our borders, but I hurried home to Tulga, ready to give Sanjar his due and share the khanate with him. But when I arrived, I found that he rushed his supporters to the court, to have himself proclaimed as the sole khan."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_2",     "My father died however before I completed my course of study, and as I hurried home to claim his throne my ship was wrecked by a storm. One of my father's thanes, Ragnar, seized this opportunity and spread rumors that I had died abroad. He summoned a gathering of his supporters to have himself proclaimed king, and has taken the past few years to consolidate his power."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_2",   "During the last selection, there were but two candidates, myself, and Lord Graveth. While the council was deliberating, Graveth appeared, sword in hand, telling them that a Swadian raiding party was about to descend on the field of deliberation -- which was true, by the way -- and if he were not elected king, then he would leave them to their fate."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "I will admit that I did my cause no good by cursing Harlaus and all who listened to him as traitors, but I also believe that the magistrates who ruled in his favor were bought. No matter -- I will raise an army of loyal subjects, who would honour their old king's memory and will. And if anyone doubts that a woman can wield power, then I will prove them wrong by taking Harlaus' ill-gotten crown away from him."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Until I have my rights restored in the sight of all the Vaegirs, I will bear the sobriquet, 'the Bastard', to remind me of what I must do."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_pretender_story_3",  "My brother thinks that Khergits will only respect strength: a leader who takes what he wants, when he wants it. But I think that he misreads the spirit of our people.--we admire a resolute leader, but even more we a just one, and we know that a man who does not respect his own brother's rights will not respect the rights of his followers."),
  ("nord_rebellion_pretender_story_3",     "So I remain in exile -- except now I am not looking for sages to tutor me in the wisdom of faraway lands, but warriors, to come with me back to the land of the Nords and regain my throne. If Ragnar doubts my ability to rule, then let him say so face to face, as we stare at each other over the rims of our shields. For a warrior can be a scholar, and a scholar a warrior, and to my mind, only one who combines the two is fit to be king!"),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_pretender_story_3",   "Well, Graveth defeated the Swadians, and for that, as a Rhodok, I am grateful. When I am king, I will myself place the wreath of victory on his head. But after that I will have it separated from his shoulders, for by his actions he has shown himself a traitor to the Rhodok confederacy and its sacred custom."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "Isolla thinks she should be Queen of the Swadians? Well, King Esterich had a kind heart, and doted on his daughter, but a good-hearted king who doesn't use his head can be a curse to his people. Isolla may tell you stories of warrior queens of old, but you might also recall that all the old legends end in the same way -- with the Swadians crushed underfoot by the armies of the Calradic Emperor."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "Were Valdym to come to me in peace, I would laden him with titles and honours, and he would become the greatest of my vassals. But as he comes in war, I will drag him before me in chains and make him acknowledge me as rightful sovereign, then cut his tongue from his mouth so that he cannot recant."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_1", "My brother Dustum has perhaps told you of his insistence upon splitting the khanate, as though it were a herd of sheep. Let me tell you something. Ever since the Khergits established themselves on this land, the death of every khan has had the same result -- the land was divided, the khan's sons went to war, and the strongest took it all anyway. I simply had the foresight to stave off the civil war in advance."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_1",    "Lethwin 'Far-Seeker'? Lethwin Inkfingers, is more like it. Perhaps you have heard the expression, 'Unhappy is the land whose king is a child.' Unhappy too is the land whose king is a student. You want the Nords to be ruled by a beardless youth, whose hand bears no callouses left by a sword's grip, who has never stood in a shield wall? If Lethwin were king, his thanes would laugh at him to his face!"),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_1",  "No doubt Lord Kastor told you that I defiled the hallowed Rhodok custom by interfering with the patricians' election of a king. Well, let me tell you something. The patricians of the towns make longwinded speeches about our ancient liberties, but then choose as their king whichever noble last sat in their villa and sipped a fine wine and promised to overlook their unpaid taxes."),

  ("swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Those who weep for the plight of a Swadian princess denied her father's throne should reflect instead on the fate of a Swadian herdswoman seized by a Vaegir raider and taken as chattel to the slave markets. Talk to me of queens and old stories when our warlike neighbors are vanquished, and our land is at peace."),
  ("vaegir_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "Whatever my father may or may not have done to secure the throne does not matter. I have inherited it, and that is final. If every old claim were to be brought up anew, if every man's inheritance could be called into question at any time, then it would be the end of the institution of kingship, and we would live in a state of constant civil war."),
  ("khergit_rebellion_monarch_response_2", "Dustum would make a fine assessor of flocks, or adjudicator of land disputes. But can you imagine such a man as khan? We would be run off of our land in no time by our neighbors, and return to our old days of starving and freezing on the steppe."),
  ("nord_rebellion_monarch_response_2",    "Old Hakrim may have had fancy ideas about how to dispose of his kingdom, but it is not just royal blood that makes a King of the Nords. I am king by acclamation of the thanes, and by right of being the strongest. That counts for more than blood, and woe to any man in this land who says otherwise."),
  ("rhodok_rebellion_monarch_response_2",  "The only liberty that concerns them is their liberty to grow fat. Meanwhile, my men sleep out on the steppe, and eat dry bread and salt fish, and scan the horizon for burning villages, and shed our blood to keep the caravan routes open. Here's an idea -- if I ever meet a merchant who limps from a Khergit arrow-wound or a Swadian sword-stroke, then I'll say, 'Here's a man whose counsel is worth taking.'"),
